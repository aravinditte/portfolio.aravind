Looking at people struggle convert a research paper into code, I thought this skill is a must.

And I developed a facial recognition system based on the 2019 Convolutional Siamese Networks paper, successfully turning a complex research idea into a working project.[Research Paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).
